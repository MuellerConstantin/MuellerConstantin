Who am I? I'm a student from Germany, who is interested in computer and data science. For me, programming isn't just a hobby but rather a passion. Hence, I'm a self-taught software developer and data scientist. At the moment I'm studying business informatics with a major in data science in Karlsruhe, Germany. Any further questions? Feel free to ask!
